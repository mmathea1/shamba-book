# Shamba Book — Farm & Field Record Keeping Tool

Shamba Book is a simple farm management tool that helps farmers record daily activities, track inputs, monitor outputs, and get better visibility into what’s happening on their farms.

The goal is to make farm record-keeping easier — so farmers can make better decisions, improve productivity, and track important events over time.

## Why I Built This

Many small farms track everything in notebooks, memory, or scattered spreadsheets.
Important details get lost — weather patterns, inputs used, incidents, yields, and sales.

Shamba Book explores how a single digital logbook can:

- give farmers better visibility into their farms

- help track costs and outputs

- support sustainability and traceability efforts

- create historical records to guide future decisions

## Core Features (current or planned)

- Daily Weather Recording
Automatically logs weather conditions such as temperature, rainfall and wind for the farm’s location.

Record yields, animal production and any produce leaving the farm.

- Incident Recording
Log breakdowns, animal health issues, disease outbreaks or other incidents.

- Sales Recording
Track what was sold, to whom, at what price — and when.

## Project Status

In progress — actively building core modules and exploring usability for non-technical users.

## What I’m Learning

- structuring agricultural data models

- making tools simple enough for everyday use

- designing systems that can work offline or in low-connectivity contexts

- thinking about sustainability and traceability in agriculture
